    <h1>Day 1</h1>
    <h2>1.What is Virtual DOM?</h2>
    <p>Virtual DOM is the in-memory representation of Real DOM.React keeps a lightweight representation of the real DOM
        in the memory, and that is known as the virtual DOM. When the state of an object changes, virtual DOM changes
        only that object in the real DOM, rather than updating all the objects.</p>

    <h2>2.What is SPA?</h2>
    <p>SPA stands for Single Page Application. It is a very common way of programming websites these days. The idea is
        that the website loads all the HTML/JS the first time you visit. When you then navigate, the browser will only
        rerender the content without refreshing the website.</p>
